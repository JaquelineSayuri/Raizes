This program (in C) calculate n real roots of a polynomial function with order n.

In the first version, there are no functions and the code got really extensive. Now, in version_2.0, it was possible to reduce some lines and the program embrace a larger number of polynomials functions. Moreover, the first code couldn't show roots that weren't simple (double roots, triple roots...). Which problem was solved in this last code.
