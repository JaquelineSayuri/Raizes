# Raizes
This program calculate n real roots of a polynomial function with order n.

In the first version, programmed in C, there are no functions and the code got really extensive. In the second, it was possible to reduce some lines and the program embrace a larger number of polynomials functions (those with coefficients who are equal to zero). Moreover, the first code couldn't show roots that weren't simple (double roots, triple roots...). Which problem was solved in raizes_C_2.0.

Now, there's a new version coded in Python that reduced even more its size.
